description: "Set up an integration to allow Sysdig runtime vulnerabilities to be fetched, triaged, and orchestrated by Splunk, using a Splunk Technical Add-On."
---

The Sysdig Vulnerability Management APIs have been extended to an official Splunk Technical Add-on (TA) that can be used from the Splunk app store, Splunkbase. Find the [Sysdig VM Splunk TA on Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/7169). 

The Splunk TA enables you to extract all Runtime (Workloads and Host) scan results. This allows Security Operation Centers to ingest vulnerability information produced by Sysdig into Splunk natively.

The Splunk TA for Sysdig Vulnerabilities is distinct from the one used for Event Forwarding. See [Forwarding to Splunk](/en/forward-splunk/).

## Prerequisites

* Splunk Enterprise 9.1.1+
* Sysdig Saas Platform with Vulnerability Management Scanning in Runtime (Workload and Host)
* Secure API token with Vulnerability Management Scan Results authorization. See [Service Accounts](/en/docs/administration/administration-settings/access-and-secrets/user-and-team-administration/manage-teams-and-roles/#service-accounts).

## Configure the Integration

### Install from the Splunkbase Marketplace

1. Log in to Splunk and search for Sysdig in [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/).

2. Select [**Sysdig VM Splunk TA** ](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/7169) and click **Download**, agreeing to the required terms and conditions.

    The .tgz file will be downloaded.

3. In Splunk, click **Apps** and then **Manage Apps** from the dropdown.
4. Click **Install App from File**.
5. Click **Choose File** and select the .tgz file you downloaded from Splunkbase. If you are upgrading, check the box beside **Upgrade app**.

    The add-on will be imported. Splunk may need to restart.

6. From Splunk's main navigation menu, select **Settings** and then **Indexes** from the dropdown. Click on **New Index**.
7. Enter an Index name, for example, "app_sysdig", and ensure **App** is set to **Sysdig VM Splunk TA**.
8. Click Save.

   **Sysdig VM Splunk TA** should now be available under **Apps** in Splunk.

9. Select **Apps** > **Sysdig VM Splunk TA** > **Inputs** > **Create New Input**.
11. Fill out the form: 
  - **Interval**: The input frequency. Since it pulls a lot of data, we recommend 86400 seconds, or once per day.
  - **Index**: Enter the Index name you chose earlier ("app_sysdig" in this example).
  - **Sysdig Secure Token**: Add the access key mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

12. Once it is filled out, click **Add**.

Splunk events will now be visible if you enter `index="sydig_vulnerabilties"` in the search bar. Replace `sysdig_vulnerabilities` with the name you chose.
