description: "Use Sysdig's Okta integration to pull logs from your enterprise's Okta installation into Sysdig Secure for threat detection and processing."
---

Okta, which manages internal and external access to systems with a single login, is the leading platform in Identity-as-a-Service. As such, it has been the target of [malicious attacks](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-investigation-of-the-january-2022-okta-compromise/) which may expose users' most critical assets and services. Enterprises can protect this area of their infrastructure using Sysdig's log analysis Okta integration. 

## Prerequisites

*  Sysdig Secure SaaS and **Admin** permissions
* An Okta organization
* **Super Administrator** Okta account permissions

## Add Integration

The integration toggles between the Sysdig Secure UI and the Okta UI. 

### Start from Sysdig Secure

1. Log in to Sysdig Secure as **Admin** and select **Integrations > Events and Logs**.

   ![](/image/events_logs.png)

2. Select **Add Integration**.

   ![](/image/okta4.png)

3. Enter your **Okta organization name** or the **URL** for your [Okta organization](https://support.okta.com/help/s/okta-sign-in?language=en_US) and click **Launch Okta**.

4. You are transferred to the Okta admin dashboard, to install the Sysdig API Service Integration.

5. By clicking on "Install & Authorize", you will be provided with a **Client Secret**. The authentication secret is periodically rotated for an additional layer of security.

   Copy it and go back to Sysdig to paste it in the installation wizard.

6. Now return to Okta and do the same with the **Client ID**.

7.  Click **Validate Connection** in the Sysdig wizard.

8. When connection is established, click **Complete** as prompted. 

   Logs from your Okta organization will be live-streamed to Sysdig. Sysdig performs threat detection through the [configured policies](#review-okta-policies-and-rules) and detections are reported as Runtime Events.

### Start from Okta

When you install the [API Service Integration app for Sysdig](https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/apiservice/add-api-service-integration.htm) from Oktaâ€™s Admin Dashboard, the installation will prompt you to copy your Client Secret and Client ID. Save these to use on the Sysdig side.

Now: 

1. Log in to Sysdig Secure SaaS as **Admin** and go to **Integrations > Events and Logs**.

2.  Select **Add Integration** choose the option *If you've already installed the Sysdig API Integration*.

3. Enter the Client Secret, Okta Domain, and Client ID you saved from Okta (toggling back to the Okta interface if needed).

4. Click **Validate Connection**, and **Complete**. 

### Troubleshoot the Installation

If the installation is failing, you can: 

- Ensure that among the API Service integrations listed on Okta, the one you chose is called "Sysdig".
- Repeat the flow starting from Okta if you previously started from Sysdig, or vice-versa.
- Re-install the Sysdig API Service integration on Okta and copy all the values to Sysdig.
- Check that your Okta organization hasn't already reached the [maximum number of allowed Event Hooks](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/Content/Topics/automation-hooks/add-event-hooks.htm).

## Validate

### Check the Connection Status

Check the connection status of your integration in the Events & Logs page by navigating to **Integrations > Data Sources > Events & Logs.**

See [Events & Logs connection status](/en/events-logs#validate-account-connection).

### Review Okta Policies and Rules

You can review the suite of Okta-related managed policies delivered out-of-the-box and/or create custom policies of the type *Okta*. 

To see the standard managed policies: 

1. In Sysdig Secure, select **Policies** >  **Runtime Policies**.

2. For the **Managed Type** filter, select **Managed Policy** and for the **Select policy type** filter, select **Okta**.

   The list of default managed policies is displayed. Select one to review the rules that comprise it. 

   ![](/image/policy_okta1.png) 

   If desired, you can create custom Okta policies in the [usual way](/en/docs/sysdig-secure/policies/threat-detect-policies/manage-policies/#steps-to-create-a-custom-policy-from-scratch). 

### Check Event Feed for Okta Entries

1. In Sysdig Secure, select **Events > Event Feed**. 

2. Enter *Okta* in the free-text search. Select any resulting policies in the list to drill into event details.

Events should arrive immediately after successful integration.  If nothing appears within five minutes, check the status of Sysdig SaaS on https://sysdig.com/company/sysdig-status/. 

## Delete an Integration

If you delete a configured integration: 

* The listiing is removed from the **Events and Logs** page
* Sysdig stops receiving logs from Okta
* Any created runtime events remain in the **Events** feed

## Appendix: Okta Setup
Sysdig relies on an [API Service Integration](https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/apiservice/api-service-integrations.htm) to connect with your Okta organization. The integration provisions an [Event Hook](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/Content/Topics/automation-hooks/event-hooks-main.htm) configured to send Sysdig the following events categories:
- application.user_membership.add
- group.user_membership.add
- system.api_token.create
- system.org.rate_limit.violation
- user.account.lock
- user.account.privilege.grant
- user.account.reset_password
- user.account.update_password
- user.authentication.auth_via_mfa
- user.authentication.sso
- user.lifecycle.activate
- user.lifecycle.create
- user.lifecycle.deactivate
- user.lifecycle.suspend
- user.lifecycle.unsuspend
- user.mfa.factor.deactivate
- user.mfa.factor.reset_all
- user.session.start
