## Filter and Sort Accounts

Use the sortable columns to organize and filter user accounts for assessing identity risks. You can sort user accounts based on the following criteria:

#### Unused Permission Criticality

Unused Permission Criticality focuses on unused permissions, while Permission Criticality looks at all permissions. Unused Permission Criticality is designed to help you achieve Least Permissive access.

Values: **Critical, High, Medium, Low**

#### Risk

This is a calculation of risk based on all permissions. See [Understanding Risk Scoring](/en/docs/sysdig-secure/identity/#understanding-risk-scoring) for more information.

Values: **Critical, High, Medium, Low**

#### % of Unused Permissions

This shows the number of unused permissions per total permissions for the user, shown as a percentage graph.

When remediating, immediately target the users with the greatest exposure and refine them according to the suggestions.

#### Highest Access

Highest Access offers a quick way to filter by **Access Category**. It shows this identity entityâ€™s highest level of access according to all of its permissions. For more information, see [Understand Highest Access](/en/docs/sysdig-secure/identity/#understand-highest-access).

Values:  

* **Admin:** Admin access granted
* **Write:** Write access granted
* **Read:** Read access granted
* **Empty Access:** No permissions are granted at all

#### Findings

A finding in Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) indicates poor security hygiene, either due to misconfiguration or inadequate identity security practices. The findings on User pages include:

* `No MFA`
* `Admin`

**AWS-Specific**

* `Access Key Not Rotated`
* `Multiple Access Keys Active`
* `Root User`
* `Inactive`

**GCP-Specific**

* `Editor Role Applied`
* `Owner Role Applied`

### Available Filters

* **Search:** Free text search on terms in the resource name
* **Unused Permission Criticalitys:** By severity
* **Cloud Accounts:** Account name or account number by cloud provider. For example,  `AWS`
* **Access Categories:** `Admin`, `Write`, `Read`, or `Empty Access`
* **Policy Types:** `AWS-Managed`, `Customer`, `Inline`
* **Findings:** See [Findings](#findings)
