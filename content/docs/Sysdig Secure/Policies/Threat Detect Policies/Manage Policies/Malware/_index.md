description: "When a Malware Control policy is created, depending on the options selected, Sysdig Agent can use a managed data bank to monitor executions in a container/on the node for any malware. When a malicious binary is detected, the agent generates an event and can optionally block the execution from starting. This feature is in Technical Preview"
---

## Prerequisites
* Sysdig Secure SaaS
* Kernel 5.x+
* Agent 13.0.1+
* Review [Set Up Notification Channels](/en/set-up-notifications).

### Configure the Sysdig Agent

Malware Control, also called Malware Detection and Prevention, is enabled by default. 

You can optionally configure the `dragent.yaml` file to:

* Disable Malware Control globally.
* Enable Malware Control for the underlying host node. 

See [Agent Configuration for Sysdig Secure](/en/configuration-library-secure) for details.

## Create a Malware Policy

1. Log in to Sysdig Secure.

2. Select **Policies** > **Threat Detection** > **Runtime Policies** to display the Runtime Policies page.

3. Click **+Add Policy** and select **Malware** policy type.

4. Configure the policy as given in [Configure a Malware Policy](#configure-a-malware-policy).

5. Click **Save**.

## Configure a Malware Policy

### Basic Parameters

**Name**: Enter a unique policy name.

**Description**: Provide a meaningful and searchable description.

**Enabled/Disabled**: Toggle to enable the policy so that it generates events.

**Severity**: Choose the appropriate severity level as you would like to see it in the Runtime Policies UI: 

**High, Medium, Low, Info**

Policy severity is subjective and is used to group policies within a Sysdig Secure instance. There is no inheritance between the underlying rule priorities and the severity you assign to the policy.

**Scope**: Define the scope to which the policy will apply, based on the type-dependent options listed.

**Link to Runbook**: (Optional) Enter the URL of a company procedure that should be followed for events resulting from this policy. For example: `https://www.mycompany.com/our-runbook-link`.

  If you provide a value here, a **View Runbook** option will appear in the corresponding event with a link to your Runbook.

### Detect

**Use Known Hashes:**  Sysdig maintains a list of known malware hashes which it checks against the executing binary. This option is enabled by default.

**Ignore Hashes:** If desired, enter known malware hashes for which you do not want the policy to trigger an event. Comma-separate your entries.

**Additional Hashes:** If desired, add known malware hashes to have them evaluated by the policy. Comma-separate your entries.

### Actions

**Prevent:** Enable the toggle to have Sysdig Secure prevent any detected malware and binaries with known hashes from executing. This option is disabled by default. When **Prevent** is disabled, malware detection triggers an event and any configured notifications. 

**Containers**: Choose which action the policy should take when the event occurs in a container. Options include:

  - **No container action**: Do not change container behavior; send a notification according to notification channel settings.
  - **Kill**: Kills one or more running containers immediately.
  - **Stop**: Allows a graceful shutdown (10-seconds) before killing the container.
  - **Pause**: Suspends all processes in the specified containers.

**Capture**: Create a capture when the policy triggers.

**Notify**: Select a notification channel from the drop-down list for sending notification of events to appropriate personnel.

Event notifications are generally limited to a frequency of once every five minutes.
