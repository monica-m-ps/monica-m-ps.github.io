## Key Features

Sysdig Secure Policies provide the following benefits:

* Visibility and understanding - The policies offer visibility into the security and integrity of cloud environments. They help you understand the behavior of your systems and identify potential threats.
* Actionable information - Sysdig Secure policies generate events based on real-time data, providing actionable information. You can leverage these events to take prompt and informed actions to mitigate risks.
* Built-in policies - Sysdig Secure provides a range of built-in policies that offer immediate value.
These pre-configured policies are designed to address common security and integrity concerns in cloud environments.
* Customization - You can fine-tune the behavior of built-in policies to align them with your specific requirements. You have the flexibility to change default configurations, enable or disable policies, and create new ones tailored to your environment.

## Uses

You can use Sysdig Secure Policies to:

* Evaluate built-in policies and identify areas that need customization. 
* Modify policy configurations to align with your organizational needs.
* Enable or disable policies based on their relevance and impact on your environment.
* Create brand new policies that address specific security concerns unique to your environment.

You can optionally use the following tools to automate policy creation:

- [Runtime Threat Detection Policy Tuning](/en/docs/sysdig-secure/policies/runtime-policy-tuning/) for reducing noisy false positives in the events feed
- [Network Security Policy Tool](/en/docs/sysdig-secure/network/) to author and fine-tune Kubernetes network policies
