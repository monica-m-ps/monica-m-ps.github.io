Description: "Out of the box, the Sysdig agent will gather and report on a wide variety of pre-defined metrics from a range of platforms and applications. It can also accommodate any number of custom parameters for additional metrics collection."
---

You can edit the agent configuration file to extend the default behavior, including additional metrics for JMX, StatsD, Prometheus, or a wide range of other [Monitoring Integrations](/en/docs/sysdig-monitor/monitoring-integrations/#monitoring-integrations). 

Use this section when you need to change the default or pre-defined settings by editing the agent configuration files.

For the latest helm-based installation instructions and configuration options, see [sysdig-deploy](https://charts.sysdig.com/charts/sysdig-deploy/).
