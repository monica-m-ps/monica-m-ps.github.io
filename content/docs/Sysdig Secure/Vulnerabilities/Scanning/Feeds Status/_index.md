The Feeds Status page shows the different vulnerability feeds with which
Sysdig integrates.

It displays the vulnerability feed group (often the distro version), the
time of the last synchronization, and how many CVE records are present
in the feed group.

To review the Feeds Status:

1.  Navigate to the `Settings` menu in the Sysdig Secure UI.

2.  Select `Feeds Status`.
