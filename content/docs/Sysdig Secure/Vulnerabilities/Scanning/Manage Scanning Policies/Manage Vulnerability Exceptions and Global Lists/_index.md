**End of Life Notice**: The Sysdig Legacy Scanning Engine will reach its End of Life (EOL) on **December 31st, 2024**. After this date, it will no longer be supported or maintained. Please upgrade to our [New Scanning Engine](/en/docs/sysdig-secure/vulnerabilities) before December 31st, 2024 to ensure continuous service and support. For assistance, contact our support team or your account representative.
{{% /callout %}}

Sysdig Secure allows users to put specific **CVEs** on **Global
Exception** lists. Common reasons to exempt a vulnerability from
consideration while scanning an image include, for example:

- Knowing that the vuln does not apply to your runtime or cannot be
    exploited

- Knowing that the suggested "fix version" will break a chain of
    dependencies, and you plan to evaluate how to patch this
    vulnerability in more detail

- Knowing that there is no available fix for the vulnerability yet and
    you absolutely must deploy this application in production. (You
    decide to use a temporary alternate security strategy to protect
    from the vulnerability.)

When devising exception lists, you can detail what exceptions you
introduce, for which images, and for how long, establishing a
**vulnerability exception management workflow**.

Additionally, specific **images** can be marked as **untrusted** or
**globally trusted** to ensure they always/never pass a scan.

Previous versions of Sysdig Secure called this feature **Whitelist and
Blacklist,** and the options were located under the Scanning Policies
tab.

Note that "blacklist" options for other entities, such as users, ports,
packages, etc., are listed in [Scanning Policy Gates and
Triggers](/en/docs/sysdig-secure/vulnerabilities/scanning/manage-scanning-policies/scanning-policy-gates-and-triggers/#scanning-policy-gates-and-triggers).

## Create Multiple Exception Lists

By default, a single list is provided. Its name,
`Default exceptions list`, can be retitled or removed if desired.

To create additional lists:

1. Select `Image Scanning > Vulnerability Exceptions` and click the
    `Add` button on the left side of the screen.

    ![](/image/vuln_list.png)

2. Enter a `Name` and `Description` and click `Save`.

    Hover over the info bubble on an existing list to see its name,
    description, and last-modified date.

3. For an exception list to be applied to an image during a scan, you
    must set up a scanning policy assignment to map the image to the
    list.

{{% callout type="note" %}}

If you delete or rename an exception list, the modification will be also
applied to the policy assignments that contain that list.

## Add a Vulnerability to a List

There are two ways to add a vulnerability to a list: from the
**Exceptions List** page, or from the **Scan Results**.

### From the Exceptions List Page

1. Select`Image Scanning > Vulnerability Exceptions` and choose the
    desired list from the left menu. (In this example, the Exception
    list is named "Python exceptions".)

2. Click the `Add` button on the right side of the screen.

3. Enter the identifying details:

    - **CVE ID:** Required

    - **Expiration Date:** Required, but can be 'never'

    - **Note** Optional.

### From the Scan Results

The scan results for an image may flag vulnerabilities you don't
consider necessary. From the results list, you can quickly append those
entries to exception lists as follows:

1. Select `Image Scanning > Scan Results`.

2. Select the Vulnerability type from the left menu and review the
    resulting list of flagged vulnerabilities.

    **Note:** The `Exceptions` column displays the number of lists
    already containing this vulnerability.

    ![](/image/scan_list.png)

3. Click the hover button to open the "Add Exception" dialog .

    ![](/image/vuln_add2.png)

4. Enter the details and click `Save`.

    - **List:** Sysdig will indicate with a "radar" icon the lists
        that are being applied to this image according to the policy
        assignments which are relevant for the evaluation of this
        particular image

        You can also enter additional list names in the field to create
        a new list.

    - **Expiration Date:** Required, but can be 'never'

    - **Note** Optional.

## Manage Vulnerabilities in a List

An exception list can contain any number of vulnerabilities. Each
vulnerability listing displays additional properties to help the
security team understand the context, feed sources, and the
justification and time span for the vulnerability to be on the list.

### Fields in the List View

Select Image Scanning &gt; Vulnerability Exceptions and choose a list
from the left menu to review the vulnerability list details.

![](/image/vuln_except2.png)

Review the column data:

- **Enabled:** On/off toggle for whether the exception for this
    vulnerability is active. If the vulnerability exception is disabled,
    it will not disappear from the list but will not be taken into
    account when evaluating an image. Rows that have met their
    expiration date are automatically disabled.

- **Name:** String entered by the user to identify the vulnerability.
    For example, `CVE-2019-9639` or `VULNDB-213986`.

- **Description:** Vulnerability description, provided by Sysdig once
    the Vuln ID is provided by the user.

- **Notes:** User-defined exception notes. Could be used to justify
    the decision or to append any additional links or information.

- **Expiration date:** Day configured by the user for this exception
    to expire.

  - Default is `never`, for a vulnerability that should not expire.
        If an expiration is set, then `day` is the minimum time
        resolution.

  - All expiration dates are evaluated against 0:00 UTC timezone

### Access and Edit Additional Details

Click on an exception row to see additional details about the
vulnerability and to edit its properties.

![](/image/vuln_details.png)

You can:

- View the full description

- View and modify user notes

- View and modify Expiration date

    Disabled exceptions cannot be re-enabled until a future date is set.

- View segmented feed information, for every feed that is reporting
    this vulnerability:

  - Severity of the vulnerability as reported per each individual
        feed (color-coded)

  - Link to vulnerability details as provided per feed

## Add Images to a Global List

There are two ways to add images to a Global Trusted or Untrusted list:
from the **list** or from a **scan result**.

**From the Global list:**

1. From the `Image Scanning` module, select either
    `Global - Trusted Images` or `Global - Untrusted Images`.

    The list of previously added images is displayed.

2. Click the `Add Image` button.

3. Add each image in a comma-separated list, then click `Ok`.

    A tag name must be valid ASCII and may contain lowercase and
    uppercase letters, digits, underscores, periods and dashes.

    A tag name may not start with a period or a dash and may contain a
    maximum of 128 characters.

**From the Scan Results:**

1. From the `Image Scanning` module, choose the `Scan Results` tab.

2. Select the relevant repository from the list and open the relevant
    image.

3. Click `Add to List` at the top of the page.

    <img src="/image/scan_results_addlist.png" width="600" height="222" />

4. Select either `Add Image to Trusted Images` or
    `Add Image to Untrusted Images` as needed.
